  <h1>Java File Copy Utility</h1>
</head>

<body>
  
  <p>This Java program serves as a file copy utility, enabling users to copy files and directories from a specified list to a destination folder.<br>
     The program is divided into two parts: Part 1 and Part 2, with varying levels of complexity and points.<br><br>
     &emsp;In Part 1, the program allows users to copy individual files from a list to the destination folder.<br>
     &emsp;If a specified path is a directory, the program will mention it and skip copying the directory.<br><br>
     &emsp;Part 2 extends the functionality of the file copy utility to handle directories recursively.<br>
     &emsp;Users can specify a list of directories and files, and the program will copy all these directories and files to the destination, maintaining the same nested structure in the destination folder.<br></p>
